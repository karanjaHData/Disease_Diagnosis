              In this project, it bid a Machine learning Decision tree map,
              Navie Bayes, Random forest algorithm by using structured and
              unstructured data from hospital. It also uses Machine learning
              algorithm for partitioning the data. To the highest of gen, none
              of the current work attentive on together data types in the zone
              of remedial big data analytics. Compared to several typical
              calculating algorithms, the scheming accuracy of the proposed
              algorithm reaches 94.8% with an regular speed which is quicker
              than that of the unimodal disease risk prediction algorithm and
              produces report.

              Object detection and tracking is an active research topic in the
              field of computer vision that makes efforts to detect, recognize,
              and track objects through a series of frames. It has been found
              that object detection and tracking in the video sequence is a
              challenging task and a very time-consuming process. Object
              detection is the first step in building a larger computer vision
              system.
